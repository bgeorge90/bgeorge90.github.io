                Climate change is impacting penguins on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctic</a> peninsula which is warming faster than almost anywhere else on earth. When it warms, it rains. When it rains, penguin chicks cannot survive. You can help! By reusing objects where you can, insulating your house, and reducing single driving trips, you can make a huge difference for penguin chicks.
